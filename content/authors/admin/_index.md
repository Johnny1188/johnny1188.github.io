<!-- Hello, I'm Jan, a master's student of computer science and a research scholar at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL). -->
Hello, I'm Jan, an undergraduate studying computer science at the Czech Technical University in Prague. At a high level, I'm interested in **how our minds work** and **how to build machines that can perceive, think, and learn**. More specifically, I'm interested in the following topics within the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) field:
- Meta-learning and cognitively inspired learning algorithms
- Active learning
- Theoretical machine learning and deep learning theory

---

## Why these topics?
Essentially, my goal is to better understand the mechanisms of the human mind and use this knowledge to empower machines with broad cognitive capabilities, enabling them to adapt to changing, unknown environments and solve novel problems. While current AI systems already exist along this spectrum of generality and problem-solving, the current state is less than satisfying.

Since generality requires adaptation and learning[^1], the efficiency and speed of these processes are critical. And why are humans so good at this? My current understanding is that it mainly stems from the following three sources:

1. **rich cognitive priors** (*innate knowledge*, evolution)
2. **active learning**
3. **self-modeling** and **self-guidance in our reasoning process**

Any system we program on a computer inherently lacks **(1)**, so there comes the need to train on large amounts of data to imbue priors similar to ours. This is why I'm interested in **theoretical machine learning** and **deep learning theory** - to gain insights into the inner workings of ML models which would enable us to design more efficient large-scale (multimodal) training. With the same motivation in mind, **(2) active learning** is crucial to the efficiency of the human learning process. We do not learn passively but rather actively seek out information that is most relevant to our current task.

Finally, as a cherry on top that enables efficient use of what the system has learned, **(3)** self-modeling and self-guidance at inference (second-order perception) seems to be of particular importance. This is where **meta-learning** and **cognitively inspired learning algorithms** come in. This is the least explored area of the three, but I believe it is crucial for the development of general AI and the most valuable direction from the cognitive/neuroscience perspective.

If you see any flaws in my reasoning or just want to share your thoughts, please do not hesitate to [contact me](#contact). I'm always happy to discuss these topics.

[^1]: The desired input-output mappings of problems to solve can clash with each other, hence this requirement.
