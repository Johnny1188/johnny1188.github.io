Hello, I'm Jan, an undergraduate studying computer science at the Czech Technical University in Prague. At a high level, I'm interested in **how our minds work** and **how to build machines that can perceive, think, and learn**. More specifically, I'm interested in the following topics within the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) field:
- Optimization
- Theoretical machine learning and deep learning theory
- Meta-learning and cognitively inspired learning algorithms
- Reinforcement learning

## Why these topics?
Essentially, my goal is to empower machines with broad cognitive capabilities, enabling them to adapt to changing, unknown environments and solve novel problems. While current AI systems already exist along this spectrum of generality and problem-solving, the current state is less than satisfying. Since generality requires adaptation and learning (the desired input-output mappings of problems to solve can clash with each other, hence this requirement), the efficiency and speed of these processes are critical. To this end, my current understanding is that human capabilities stem from three crucial sources:

1. rich cognitive priors (*innate knowledge*, evolution),
2. active learning, and
3. self-inspection and self-guidance in our reasoning process.

Any system we program on a computer inherently lacks (1), and so there comes the need to train on large amounts of data to imbue priors similar to ours. Here is why I work on **optimization**, **theoretical machine learning**, and **deep learning theory** - to enable this large-scale (multimodal) training.

Next, (2) - active learning - is crucial to the efficiency of our learning process. We do not learn passively but rather actively seek out information that is most relevant to our current task. **Reinforcement learning (RL)** is a possible incarnation of this. Furthermore, I consider RL to be the application domain of this whole framework.

Finally, as a cherry on the top that enables efficient use of what the system has learned, we might want to imbue (3) - self-inspection and self-guidance at inference ("reasoning"). This is where **meta-learning** and **cognitively inspired learning algorithms** come in.

If you see any flaws in my reasoning or just want to share your thoughts, please do not hesitate to [contact me](#contact). I'm always happy to discuss these topics.
