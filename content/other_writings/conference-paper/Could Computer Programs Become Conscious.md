abstract: This  essay  investigates  whether  computer  programs  can  achieve  consciousness, navigating  the  intersection  of  philosophy,  cognitive  science,  and computer science. Beginning with a historical overview of consciousness from Plato to Chalmers' "hard problem", it contrasts physicalism, which grounds consciousness in physical processes, with dualism, which views both mental and physical as fundamental. Adopting physical causal  closure  and  functionalism,  the  essay  introduces  the  concept  of  simulated dualism, explaining why standard dualism seems natural. Then, it describes and argues for Virtualism, a computational theory that views consciousness as a representation of oneself  experiencing  something.  In  turn,  Virtualism  is  used  to  address  common arguments like the Knowledge and Conceivability Arguments and defend the possibility of  computer  consciousness  against  objections  based  on  biological  naturalism  and embodiment. Finally, this essay reframes and answers positively to the question "Can computer programs implement consciousness?", arguing for why we should reconsider the mind-machine boundary.
